This client-side application has been created with React, implementing GraphQL for the consumption of the Rick And Morty public API.
https://rickandmortyapi.com/

To run the application just run the following command
npm run dev

Once the command is executed, you can click on the localhost link that is printed by console, and the application will open with the initial design of the requested mockup.

Pending to finish consuming the service and styling the page.

Thank you very much.
